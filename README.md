In this project, I focused on cleaning and preparing a Glassdoor dataset containing employee reviews, salary information, and company ratings. The goal was to ensure the data was ready for analysis, allowing for accurate insights into workplace trends and employee sentiments.

Through these cleaning steps, I transformed the Glassdoor dataset into a robust resource for analysis. The cleaned data not only provided a clearer view of employee sentiments and company performance but also set the stage for deeper analyses, such as sentiment scoring and trend identification. This project reinforced the critical role of data cleaning in ensuring data integrity and the accuracy of insights derived from analysis.

I have tried to clean some data here. 
I have downloaded this dataset form kaggle. This dataset contains information about the job titles, job description and the estimated salary of different positions in different organisation. Here's the link to this dataset
